To-Do List App

This is a simple and responsive to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them easily. The design is clean, with smooth transitions created using CSS keyframes.

Overview

The app focuses on basic task management in a minimal and user-friendly layout.
Clicking on a task toggles a line-through effect to mark it as done, and clicking again removes it.
Each task can also be deleted instantly with a single click.
